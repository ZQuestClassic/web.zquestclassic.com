How to customize a font:
Place a file with a specific name in the 'customfonts' folder, which is a valid allegro font bitmap.
The valid names are:

For large mode-
large_dialog.bmp
large_favcmd.bmp
large_gui.bmp
large_title.bmp
large_textbox.bmp
large_ttip.bmp
large_info.bmp

For compact mode-
compact_dialog.bmp
compact_favcmd.bmp
compact_gui.bmp
compact_title.bmp
compact_textbox.bmp
compact_ttip.bmp
compact_info.bmp

If any of these files is found, and is valid, and the 'Custom Fonts' option is enabled in ZQuest, then the custom font will be used instead of the font set in font settings.
